# Trying to learn assembly basics

## To run these asm scripts

- Make sure you have nasm and a VM (my case qemu) install
- then just give the following command to make the run script excuetable
  ```bash
    chmod 777 ./run.sh
  ```
- then run the script with desired input, for example if you want to run the alphabets script do
  ```bash
    ./run.sh alphabets
  ```
